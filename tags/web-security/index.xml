Sites that need to keep up with specific information about you (or how you interact with the site) save small files called &amp;ldquo;cookies&amp;rdquo; on your computer. Legitimate sites (ones that gather, and process information about you) are obligated to have a privacy policy posted somewhere on their website that will tell you what they collect, how they utilize cookies and other web &amp;ldquo;beacons&amp;rdquo; or trackers, and generally what they intend on doing with said data they&amp;rsquo;ve collected. Additionally, sites that store these cookies tell the browser how they are to be accessed and under what conditions, which can be under secure or insecure methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sites that do not implement secure cookie handling can end up exposing sensitive data to attackers, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to know good the basics around cookie hygiene. Read on to see how sites can secure these values, how you can check the security of these values, remove them when needed, and an extra bit on how to win at the popular &lt;em>Wordle&lt;/em> word game the first time, every time!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
