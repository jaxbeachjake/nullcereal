&lt;p>The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.

&lt;p>While I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to &lt;em>first-rate intelligence&lt;/em> I feel like this quote perfectly describes my role in information security.

At this point most organizations have methods to determine risk, and threat model certain business decisions. This is part of my job and the basis for this post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
